  abstract = {The increasing food demands of a growing human population and the need for an environmentally friendly strategy for sustainable agricultural development require signiﬁcant attention when addressing the issue of enhancing crop productivity. Here we discuss the role of integrated nutrient management (INM) in resolving these concerns, which has been proposed as a promising strategy for addressing such challenges. INM has multifaceted potential for the improvement of plant performance and resource efﬁciency while also enabling the protection of the environment and resource quality. This review examines the concepts, objectives, procedures and principles of INM. A comprehensive literature search revealed that INM enhances crop yields by 8–150\% compared with conventional practices, increases water-use efﬁciency, and the economic returns to farmers, while improving grain quality and soil health and sustainability. Model simulation and fate assessment further reveal that reactive nitrogen (N) losses and GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions are reduced substantially under advanced INM practices. Lower inputs of chemical fertilizer and therefore lower human and environmental costs (such as intensity of land use, N use, reactive N losses and GHG emissions) were achieved under advanced INM practices without compromising crop yields. Various approaches and perspectives for further development of INM in the near future are also proposed and discussed. Strong and convincing evidence indicates that INM practice could be an innovative and environmentally friendly strategy for sustainable agriculture worldwide.},

  abstract = {Our increasing dependence on a small number of agricultural crops, such as corn, is leading to reductions in agricultural biodiversity. Reductions in the number of crops in rotation or the replacement of rotations by monocultures are responsible for this loss of biodiversity. The belowground implications of simplifying agricultural plant communities remain unresolved; however, agroecosystem sustainability will be severely compromised if reductions in biodiversity reduce soil C and N concentrations, alter microbial communities, and degrade soil ecosystem functions as reported in natural communities. We conducted a meta-analysis of 122 studies to examine crop rotation effects on total soil C and N concentrations, and the faster cycling microbial biomass C and N pools that play key roles in soil nutrient cycling and physical processes such as aggregate formation. We speciﬁcally examined how rotation crop type and management practices inﬂuence C and N dynamics in different climates and soil types. We found that adding one or more crops in rotation to a monoculture increased total soil C by 3.6\% and total N by 5.3\%, but when rotations included a cover crop (i.e., crops that are not harvested but produced to enrich the soil and capture inorganic N), total C increased by 8.5\% and total N 12.8\%. Rotations substantially increased the soil microbial biomass C (20.7\%) and N (26.1\%) pools, and these overwhelming effects on microbial biomass were not moderated by crop type or management practices. Crop rotations, especially those that include cover crops, sustain soil quality and productivity by enhancing soil C, N, and microbial biomass, making them a cornerstone for sustainable agroecosystems.

Across environments, rye and rye mixtures produced the greatest spring aboveground biomass (758 kg ha–1), C, and N accumulation, had some of the lowest spring soil nitrate concentrations, and generally produced the lowest corn leaf chlorophyll. Rye accounted for more than 79\% of spring aboveground biomass accumulation in rye mixtures. Triticale and camelina monoculture produced approximately 50\% less biomass than rye or mixtures with rye. Cover crops in monoculture and mixtures did not influence surface soil temperature, soil P or K concentrations, weed density, weed community, or corn yield. Cover crops had limited influence on volumetric soil water content. Cover crop mixtures had no advantages over monocultures except for increasing fall stand density.

A corn–soybean rotation that included a rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop was studied at two Minnesota locations in 2002 and 2003 to evaluate rye management method and timing for no-till soybean production. Fall-planted rye following corn harvest at Waseca and Rosemount was managed the next spring by: (i) mowing once, (ii) mowing twice, (iii) applying glyphosate herbicide once, (iv) applying herbicide twice, and (v) mowing once followed by applying herbicide, with four mow dates beginning 1 May separated by approximately 1 wk. Rye regrowth after mowing but before stem elongation in early to mid-May was similar to that of uncut rye but decreased dramatically when mowed at anthesis in early June. At Rosemount, low weed populations and the presence of the rye cover crop, when properly managed, had only a minimal affect on soybean yield, resulting in the onepass mowing system being equally profitable as the no-rye two-pass herbicide system. At Waseca, where weed pressure was high, the rye cover crop treatments without subsequent herbicide application as well as the early one-pass herbicide applications did not provide adequate control, making these systems less profitable. Our research indicated soybean yields following a rye cover crop were often comparable to yields where no rye cover crop was grown, but economic returns were usually reduced.},

This research study assessed the influence of planting and termination dates on mechanical cover crop control efficacy to limit tillage and herbicide use using a roller/crimper. A thermal-based phenological model using growing degree days (GDD; base 4.4°C) was developed to predict cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) growth stage. Mechanical control of cereal rye increased as rye matured. Variations in cereal rye cultivar growth rates were observed; however, they responded similarly to rolling when terminated at the same growth stage. Consistent control was achieved at a Zadoks growth stage 61 (rye anthesis). A thermal-based phenological model separating the effects of heat units accumulated in the fall (FallGDD) from those accumulated in the spring (SpringGDD) best predicted the phenological development of cereal rye. Predicting when cereal rye can be successfully controlled using a roller/crimper along with the use of the thermalbased phenological model should aid growers in decision-making regarding cereal rye planting and termination dates.},

  abstract = {A winter rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop can be seeded after corn (Zea mays L.) silage to mitigate some of the environmental concerns associated with corn silage production. Rye can be managed as a cover crop by chemical termination or harvested for forage. A field study was conducted in Morris, MN in 2008 and 2009 to determine the impact of killed vs. harvested rye cover crops on soil moisture and NO3–N, and to monitor the impact of the rye on subsequent corn yield. Corn for silage was seeded either after winter fallow (control), after a rye cover crop terminated 3 to 4 wk before corn planting (killed rye), or after a rye forage crop harvested no more than 2 d before corn planting (harvested rye). Soil moisture after killed rye was similar to the control, but after harvested rye was 16\% lower. Available soil NO3–N was decreased after both killed rye (35\%) and harvested rye (59\%) compared to the control. Corn biomass yield after killed rye was similar to the control, but yield following harvested rye was reduced by 4.5 Mg ha−1. Total forage biomass yield (silage + rye) was similar for all treatments. This work demonstrates that the environmental benefits of a winter rye cover crop can be achieved without impacting corn yield, but the later termination required for rye forage production resulted in soil resource depletion and negatively impacted corn silage yield.},

The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of spring-sown cover crop mixture diversity and mechanical cover crop termination method on cover crop and/or cash crop productivity, soil moisture and N, and profitability in an organic cropping system. An experiment was conducted between 2009 and 2011 near Mead, NE, where mixtures of two (2CC), four (4CC), six (6CC), and eight (8CC) cover crop species, or a summer annual weed mixture were included in a sunflower–soybean–corn rotation. Cover crops were terminated in late May using a field disk or sweep plow undercutter. Undercutting cover crops increased soil NO3–N (0–20 cm) by 1.0 and 1.8 mg NO3–N kg–1 relative to disk incorporation in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Cover crop mixtures often reduced soil moisture (0–8 cm) before main crop planting, though cover crop termination with the undercutter increased soil moisture content by as much as 0.024 cm3 cm–3 compared to termination with the disk during early main crop growth. Crop yields were not influenced by cover crop mixture, but termination with the undercutter increased corn and soybean yield by as much as 1.40 and 0.88 Mg ha–1, respectively. Despite differences in productivity between spring cover crop mixtures and weed communities, crop yield was not different among these treatments; thus, profitability of the weed mixture–undercutter treatment combination was greatest due to reduced input costs.},

  abstract = {The termination of cover crops in conventional no-till systems is mostly conducted mechanically in combination with herbicides. Combining flaming and roller crimpers could be a viable solution to avoid using herbicides for cover crop termination in farming systems where herbicides are banned, or at least to reduce their use in an integrated management approach. This research tested the effects of flaming used in combination with three different types of roller crimpers to terminate a fall-sown cover crop mixture of winter pea and barley. The cover crop termination rate was visually assessed in terms of percentage of green cover provided by cover crop plants at different intervals from the termination date, and estimated using a log-logistic non-linear regression model with four parameters. Machine performance data are also reported. The results show that, irrespective of the roller type, flaming significantly boosted the effect of the roller crimpers. In fact, an economic threshold for cover crop suppression of 85\% was reached only when the rollers were used in combination with flaming. Nevertheless, none of the methods were able to reach the 100\% of cover crop suppression. In some case, the combined use of flaming and roller crimpers allowed reaching the 90\% of cover crop devitalisation, which happened six weeks after the termination date. More importantly, the use of flaming in combination with rollers shortened the time needed to achieve the estimated levels of devitalisation, compared with the rollers used alone. We conclude that flaming is an effective tool to increase the effectiveness of roller crimpers. Nevertheless, further research is needed to identify solutions to overcome the barrier of the high operational costs of flaming, which is constraining its wider adoption by farmers. Future studies could focus, for instance, on the development of a new prototype of combined machine for crimping and flaming the cover crops simultaneously, which could potentially reduce the operational costs.},

Field studies were conducted near Concord, NE, U.S.A., in 2008–2009 and 2009–2010. This study compared no-till [roller/crimper (CRIMP) and broadcast propane flame (FLAME)] and spring disk (DISK) termination of legume, grass, and broadleaf CCs and their effects on a subsequent maize or soybean crop. Before sowing the grain, overwintering CC species were terminated; frost-killed (FROST) CCs were also disked in the spring. Weeds were controlled via cultivation in the tilled systems (DISK and FROST); CC residue was left as a surface mulch in the no-till systems (CRIMP and FLAME). Termination method/tillage regime had greater influence than CC species on grain yield and quality, with tilled treatments performing better than CRIMP and FLAME, likely due to early season weed pressure and low stand establishment in the no-till treatments. Maize yield for the DISK system was on average 6.8 Mg ha−1 in both trials, while FLAME and CRIMP produced 57–78\% less. Soybean yields for DISK were 3.3 and 2.0 Mg ha−1; CRIMP and FLAME produced 21–33\% less in 2009 and 56\% less in 2010. The CCs best suited to no-till systems were winter rye (superior biomass) and hairy vetch (successful mechanical termination). FLAME performed as well as CRIMP. The results suggested that no-till CC termination should be employed within a comprehensive weed management system to minimise yield losses due to weeds and CC regrowth.},

  abstract = {The recent interest in cover crops as a component of Midwest corn and soybean production systems has led to a greater need to understand the most effective herbicide treatments for cover crop termination prior to planting corn or soybean. Previous research has shown that certain cover crop species can significantly reduce subsequent cash crop yields if not completely terminated. Two field experiments were conducted in 2013, 2014, and 2015 to determine the most effective herbicide program for the termination of winter wheat, cereal rye, crimson clover, Austrian winter pea, annual ryegrass, and hairy vetch; and cover crops were terminated in early April or early May. Visual control and above ground biomass reduction was determined 28 d after application (DAA). Control of grass cover crop species was often best with glyphosate alone or combined with 2,4-D, dicamba, or saflufenacil. The most consistent control of broadleaf cover crops occurred following treatment with glyphosate 2,4-D, dicamba, or saflufenacil. In general, control of cover crops was higher with early April applications compared to early May. In a separate study, control of 15-, 25-, and 75-cm tall annual ryegrass was highest with glyphosate at 2.8 kg ha-1 or glyphosate at 1.4 kg ha-1 plus clethodim at 0.136 kg ha-1. Paraquat- or glufosinate-containing treatments did not provide adequate annual ryegrass control. For practitioners who desire higher levels of cover crop biomass, these results indicate that adequate levels of cover crop control can still be achieved in the late spring with certain herbicide treatments. But it is important to consider cover crop termination well in advance to ensure the most effective herbicide or herbicide combinations are used and the products are applied at the appropriate stage.Nomenclature: Annual ryegrass, Lolium perenne L. ssp. multiflorum (Lam.)

  abstract = {Cover crop acreage has substantially increased over the last few years due to the intent of growers to capitalize on federal conservation payments and incorporate sustainable practices into agricultural systems. Despite all the known benefits, widespread adoption of cover crops still remains limited due to potential cost and management requirements. Cover crop termination is crucial, because a poorly controlled cover crop can become a weed and lessen the yield potential of the current cash crop. A field study was conducted in fall 2015 and 2016 at the Arkansas Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Fayetteville to evaluate preplant herbicide options for terminating cover crops. Glyphosate-containing treatments controlled 97\% to 100\% of cereal rye and wheat, but glyphosate alone controlled less than 57\% of legume cover crops. The most effective way to control hairy vetch, Austrian winterpea, and crimson clover with glyphosate resulted from mixtures of glyphosate with glufosinate, 2,4-D, and dicamba. Higher rates of auxin herbicides improved control in these mixtures. Glufosinate alone or in mixture controlled legume cover crops 81\% or more. Paraquat plus metribuzin was effective in terminating both cereal and legume cover crops, with control of cereal cover crops ranging from 87\% to 97\% and control of legumes ranging from 90\% to 96\%. None of these herbicides or mixtures adequately controlled rapeseed.Nomenclature: 2,4-D; dicamba; glufosinate; glyphosate; metribuzin; paraquat; Austrian winterpea, Lathryrus hirsutus L.; cereal rye, Secale cereale L.; crimson clover, Trifolium incarnatum L.; hairy vetch, Vicia villosa Roth; rapeseed, Brassica napus L.; wheat, Triticum aestivum L.},

  abstract = {Stakeholders were surveyed across Nebraska to identify the problem weeds and assess common weed management practices. A total of 425 responses were returned across four Nebraska extension districts (Northeast, Panhandle, Southeast, and West Central). Collectively, 61.2\% of total farmed or scouted areas in Nebraska were under no-till production, and corn and soybean were the major crops (82.3\% of total farmed or scouted area). Common waterhemp, horseweed, and kochia were the most problematic weeds statewide. Widespread occurrence of glyphosate-resistant (GR) weeds such as common waterhemp, horseweed, kochia, and Palmer amaranth were a serious problem in GR crop production. Additionally, 60\% of growers in Nebraska reported the presence of at least one GR weed species on their farms. The most commonly used preplant burndown herbicides were 2,4-D and glyphosate, followed by saflufenacil and dicamba. In Nebraska, 74\% and 59\% of corn and soybean growers, respectively, were using PRE herbicides; however, more than 80\% of growers were using POST herbicides for in-crop weed management. Atrazine alone or in premix or tank mix with mesotrione, S-metolachlor, or acetochlor were the most widely applied PRE herbicides in corn and grain sorghum, whereas the most commonly used PRE herbicides in soybean were the inhibitors of acetolactate synthase (ALS) and protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO). Glyphosate was the most frequent choice of the survey respondents as a POST herbicide in GR corn and soybean; 2,4-D was the most commonly used POST herbicide in grain sorghum and wheat. In Nebraska, only 5.2\% of total crop area was planted with glufosinate-resistant crops. Most of the respondents (89\%) were aware of the new multiple herbicide–resistant crops, and 80\% of them listed physical drift and volatility of the auxinic herbicides as their primary concern. Forty-eight percent of survey respondents identified herbicide-resistant weed management as their primary research and extension priority.},

However, herbicide-resistant (HR) weed populations are evolving rapidly as a natural response to selection pressure imposed by modern agricultural management activities. Mitigating the evolution of herbicide resistance depends on reducing selection through diversification of weed control techniques, minimizing the spread of resistance genes and genotypes via pollen or propagule dispersal, and eliminating additions of weed seed to the soil seedbank.

  abstract = {Winter annual weeds are becoming prolific in agricultural fields in the midwestern United States. The objectives of this research were to understand the roles of soil temperature (daily average and fluctuation) and moisture on the emergence of nine winter annual weed species and dandelion and to develop predictive models for weed emergence based on the accumulation of modified thermal/hydrothermal time (mHTT). Experiments were established at Lincoln, NE; Mead, NE; and at two sites (irrigated and rainfed) near Clay Center, NE, in 2010 and 2011. In July of each year, 1,000 seeds of each species were planted in 15 by 20 by 6-cm mesh baskets installed between soybean rows. Soil temperature and water content were recorded at the 2-cm depth. Emerged seedlings were counted and removed from the baskets on a weekly basis until no additional emergence was observed in the fall, resumed in late winter, and continued until emergence ceased in late spring. Weather data were used to accumulate mHTT beginning on August 1. A Weibull function was selected to fit cumulative emergence (\%) on cumulative mHTT (seven base temperature [Tbase
] by six base water potential [Ψ
base
] by three base temperature fluctuation [Fbase
] candidate threshold values = 126 models); it was also fit to days after August 1 (DAA1), for a total of 127 candidate models per species. The search for optimal base thresholds was based on the theoretic-model comparison approach (Akaike information criterion [AIC]). All three components (Tbase
, Ψ
base
, and Fbase
) were only important for Virginia pepperweed. For downy brome and purslane speedwell, including Tbase
 and Ψ
base
 resulted in the best fit, whereas for dandelion including Tbase
 and Fbase
 resulted in the best fit. A model including only Tbase
 resulted in the best fit for most species included in this study (Carolina foxtail, shepherd's-purse, pinnate tansymustard, henbit, and field pansy). For field pennycress, the model based on DAA1 resulted in the best fit. Threshold values were species specific. Soil temperature was the major environmental factor influencing winter annual weed emergence. Even though soil moisture and often temperature fluctuation are essential for seed germination, Ψ
base
 and Fbase
 were not as critical in the predictive models as initially expected. Most seedlings ({$>$} 90\%) of downy brome, pinnate tansymustard, Carolina foxtail, henbit, and field pansy emerged during the fall. Virginia pepperweed, purslane speedwell, dandelion, shepherd's-purse, and field pennycress seedlings emerged during both fall and spring. The results of this research provide robust information on the prediction of the time of winter annual weed emergence, which can help growers make better management decisions.},

  abstract = {Since its commercial introduction in 1974, glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] has become the dominant herbicide worldwide. There are several reasons for its success. Glyphosate is a highly effective broad-spectrum herbicide, yet it is very toxicologically and environmentally safe. Glyphosate translocates well, and its action is slow enough to take advantage of this. Glyphosate is the only herbicide that targets 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), so there are no competing herbicide analogs or classes. Since glyphosate became a generic compound, its cost has dropped dramatically. Perhaps the most important aspect of the success of glyphosate has been the introduction of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant crops in 1996. Almost 90\% of all transgenic crops grown worldwide are glyphosate resistant, and the adoption of these crops is increasing at a steady pace. Glyphosate/glyphosate-resistant crop weed management offers significant environmental and other benefits over the technologies that it replaces. The use of this virtually ideal herbicide is now being threatened by the evolution of glyphosate-resistant weeds. Adoption of resistance management practices will be required to maintain the benefits of glyphosate technologies for future generations. Copyright © 2008 Society of Chemical Industry},

The survey measured producers' crop history, perception of glyphosate-resistant (GR) weeds, past and present weed pressure, tillage practices, and herbicide use as affected by the adoption of GR crops. This article describes the changes in tillage practice reported in the survey. The adoption of a GR cropping system resulted in a large increase in the percentage of growers using no-till and reduced-till systems. Tillage intensity declined more in continuous GR cotton and GR soybean (45 and 23\%, respectively) than in rotations that included GR corn or non-GR crops. Tillage intensity declined more in the states of Mississippi and North Carolina than in the other states, with 33\% of the growers in these states shirting to more conservative tillage practices after the adoption of a GR crop. This was primarily due to the lower amount of conservation tillage adoption in these states before GR crop availability. Adoption rates of no-till and reduced-till systems increased as farm size decreased. Overall, producers in a crop rotation that included a GR crop shifted from a relatively more tillage-intense system to reduced-till or no-till systems after implementing a GR crop into their production system.]},

Planting methods included directed broadcast into the inter-row (DBC), directed broadcast with light incorporation (DBC+INC), and a high-clearance drill (DRILL). The DRILL method achieved greater fall biomass than DBC for all species except pennycress, and DRILL and DBC+INC increased red clover and hairy vetch spring biomass compared with DBC. Cover crops did not affect corn grain or silage yield and reduced yield of the subsequent soybean crop by 0.4 Mg ha−1 (10\%) only when poor termination of hairy vetch occurred at one site. Cover crops with {$>$}390 kg ha−1 of spring biomass reduced soil nitrateN compared with the no-cover control. These results support that cover crops can be interseeded into corn at the seven-leaf collar stage in the upper Midwest to reduce soil nitrate-N while maintaining corn and subsequent soybean yields; however, effective cover crop termination is critical to avoid competition with the subsequent soybean crop.},

We quantified the effects of corn density on weed biomass, cover crop biomass, and corn grain yield. Increasing corn density had a direct negative effect on interseeded cover crop biomass as well as indirect effects that were mediated by light transmission and weeds. At two sites, corn grain yield at the low corn density (3.71 plants m–2) did not differ from corn grain yield at the standard density (7.41 plants m–2). We also compared plots with and without interseeded cover crops at the same standard corn planting density. Corn grain yield did not differ, but weed biomass at the October sample date was 31\% lower in plots with interseeded cover crops compared to plots without. Our results suggest that organic farmers may be able to (i) improve weed suppression in corn by interseeding cover crops and (ii) optimize cropping system performance by planting corn at a slightly lower rate (e.g., 5–10\%) than what is typically used when interseeding cover crops. Additional research should be conducted across a wider range of environments to determine corn planting rate recommendations that optimize corn yield, cover crop growth, weed suppression, and profitability in organic cropping systems.},

Cereal rye had the highest spring biomass in all mixtures, especially AM. Pea spring biomass was disproportionally greater in relation to seeding rate in the six-species mixture (6 Spp.) than in monoculture when planted AW. A four-species mixture (4 Spp.) planted AW retained the highest diversity after overwintering in two of the three planting years. Our study demonstrated that (i) cover crop mixtures retain higher diversity when allowed sufficient growth in fall; (ii) cereal rye dominates mixtures in spring, particularly when fall planting is delayed; (iii) grasses overperform in mixtures compared to their growth in monocultures; (iv) brassicas underperform in mixtures vs. monocultures; and (v) legume growth in mixtures depends on species and planting time.},

In August and September of 2017, a survey of 312 farmers from 60 Nebraska soybean-producing counties was conducted during extension field days or online. The objective of this survey was to understand farmers’ adoption and perceptions regarding DR soybean technology in Nebraska. The survey contained 16 questions and was divided in three parts: (1) demographics, (2) dicamba application in DR soybean, and (3) dicamba off-target injury to sensitive soybean cultivars. According to the results, 20\% of soybean hectares represented by the survey were planted to DR soybean in 2017, and this number would probably double in 2018. Sixty-five percent of survey respondents own a sprayer and apply their own herbicide programs. More than 90\% of respondents who adopted DR soybean technology reported significant improvement in weed control. Nearly 60\% of respondents used dicamba alone or glyphosate plus dicamba for POST weed control in DR soybean; the remaining 40\% added an additional herbicide with an alternative site of action (SOA) to the POST application. All survey respondents used one of the approved dicamba formulations for application in DR soybean. Survey results indicated that late POST dicamba applications (after late June) were more likely to result in injury to non-DR soybean compared to early POST applications (e.g., May and early June) in 2017. According to respondents, off-target dicamba movement resulted both from applications in DR soybean and dicamba-based herbicides applied in corn. Although 51\% of respondents noted dicamba injury on non-DR soybean, 7\% of those who noted injury filed an official complaint with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Although DR soybean technology allowed farmers to achieve better weed control during 2017 than previous growing seasons, it is apparent that off-target movement and resistance management must be addressed to maintain the viability and effectiveness of the technology in the future.},

  abstract = {The introduction of soybean and cotton traits with resistance to synthetic auxin herbicides has led to an increase in concern over the off-target movement of dicamba and 2,4-D. A direct-mail survey was sent to Missouri pesticide applicators in January of 2016 to understand current herbicide application practices and applicator knowledge and awareness of the new synthetic auxin technologies. Completed surveys were returned by 2,335 applicators, representing approximately 11\% of the state’s registered pesticide applicators. Survey data reported herein provides information regarding current pesticide applicator knowledge and practices and highlights areas that need more emphasis during applicator training. Overall, survey respondents were familiar with physical drift and methods to minimize that risk. However respondents were less familiar with volatility and temperature inversions, which can each influence off-target herbicide movement. Of the 427 commercial applicators and 1,535 noncommercial applicators who answered questions regarding volatility, 81\% and 74\% respectively, recognized that high temperatures can contribute to a herbicide’s ability to volatilize. However, only 48\% and 39\% understood that a herbicide’s vapor pressure influences volatility. Answers from the survey indicate further education is needed on the synthetic auxin technologies, such as what herbicides can be used with each technology, proper methods for inspecting and cleaning spray equipment, and the importance of reading herbicide labels. When asked whether applicators were aware of the new 2,4-D-resistant and dicamba-resistant traits, 76\% of 443 commercial applicators and only 40\% of 1,713 noncommercial applicators selected “yes.” Additionally, survey results suggests that current methods aimed to facilitate communication among producers and applicators, such as FieldWatch and Flag the Technology, may not be successfully adopted, at least in Missouri. Findings from this survey can be utilized to enhance training of pesticide applicators in preparation for the synthetic auxin herbicide technologies.

La introducción de soja y algodón con resistencia a herbicidas auxinas sintéticas ha generado preocupación por el movimiento accidental de dicamba y 2,4−D a lugares no deseados. En Enero de 2016 se envió una encuesta vía correo directo a aplicadores de plaguicidas con licencia de Missouri para entender las prácticas de aplicación de herbicidas actuales y el conocimiento de los aplicadores acerca de las nuevas tecnologías de auxinas sintéticas. Se recibieron 2,335 encuestas completadas por aplicadores, lo que representó 11\% del registro de aplicadores de plaguicidas del estado. Los datos de la encuesta presentados aquí brindan información acerca del conocimiento y prácticas actuales de los aplicadores de plaguicidas y resaltan las áreas que necesitan mayor énfasis para la capacitación de los aplicadores. En general, los encuestados estaban familiarizados con la volatilidad y las inversiones de temperatura, las cuales pueden influenciar el movimiento accidental del herbicida a zonas no deseadas. De los 427 aplicadores comerciales y los 1,535 aplicadores no comerciales que contestaron las preguntas relacionadas a volatilidad, 81\% y 74\% respectivamente, reconocieron que las altas temperaturas pueden contribuir a la habilidad del herbicida de volatilizarse. Sin embargo, solamente 48\% y 39\% entendía que la presión de vapor del herbicida influencia la volatilidad. Las respuestas en la encuesta indican que se necesita más educación acerca de las tecnologías con auxinas sintéticas, como cuáles herbicidas pueden ser usados con cada tecnología, métodos adecuados para inspeccionar y limpiar los equipos de aspersión, y la importancia de leer la etiqueta del herbicida. Cuando se preguntó si los aplicadores estaban al tanto de los nuevos cultivos con resistencia a 2,4−D y dicamba, 76\% de 443 aplicadores comerciales y solamente 40\% de 1,713 aplicadores no comerciales seleccionaron “sí”. Adicionalmente, los resultados de la encuesta sugieren que los métodos actuales dirigidos a facilitar la comunicación entre productores y aplicadores, tales como FieldWatch y la tecnología de Banderas, podrían no ser adoptadas exitosamente, al menos en Missouri. Los descubrimientos de esta encuesta pueden ser utilizados para mejorar la capacitación de aplicadores de plaguicidas en preparación para el uso de las tecnologías de herbicidas auxinas sintéticas.},

  abstract = {[Composition and abundance of weed populations often change in response to new or extensively used weed management practices. Glyphosate-resistant (GR) technology is one such weed management practice now used extensively. A recent survey of weed scientists was conducted to address weed shifts in GR corn, cotton, and soybean. Twelve scientists in 11 states responded to the survey. Averaged over estimates from scientists, GR corn, cotton, and soybean were planted on 15, 90, and 88\% of the hectarage in 2003, respectively. Acreage of GR corn is expected to rise, whereas only minor changes in acreage of GR cotton or soybean are expected. Weed shifts have not been observed in GR corn but have occurred in GR cotton and soybean. In GR cotton, Amaranthus, Commelina, Ipomoea, and Cyperus species as well as annual grasses were noted as becoming more problematic. Similar to cotton, Ipomoea and Commelina species are becoming more troublesome in GR soybean. In addition, in GR soybean, various winter annuals, lambsquarters species, and waterhemp species were noted as becoming more problematic. All scientists felt that weeds shifts were occurring, and two-thirds of these scientists noted that weed shifts are currently of economic concern. The scientists recommend the following to help manage weed shifts: additional herbicides in mixture with glyphosate, rotation to herbicides other than glyphosate, rotation to non-GR crops, and greater use of soil-applied herbicides.]},

  abstract = {With the recent confirmation of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO)-resistant Palmer amaranth in the US South, concern is increasing about the sustainability of weed management in cotton production systems. Cover crops can help to alleviate this problem, as they can suppress weed emergence via allelochemicals and/or a physical residue barrier. Field experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 at the Arkansas Agricultural Research and Extension Center to evaluate various cover crops for suppressing weed emergence and protecting cotton yield. In both years, cereal rye and wheat had the highest biomass production, whereas the amount of biomass present in spring did not differ among the remaining cover crops. All cover crops initially diminished Palmer amaranth emergence. However, cereal rye provided the greatest suppression, with 83\% less emergence than in no cover crop plots. Physical suppression of Palmer amaranth and other weeds with cereal residues is probably the greatest contributor to reducing weed emergence. Seed cotton yield in the legume and rapeseed cover crop plots were similar when compared with the no cover crop treatment. The seed cotton yield collected from cereal cover crop plots was lower than from other treatments due to decreased cotton stand.},

  abstract = {Measuring shikimic acid accumulation in response to glyphosate applications can be a rapid and accurate way to quantify and predict glyphosate-induced damage to sensitive plants. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effect of cover crop termination timing by glyphosate application on rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield in a no-till system. A factorial experiment, arranged in a split-plot design, was conducted for 2 yr. Treatments consisted of cover crops (main plots) and timed herbicide applications (subplots) to these cover crops (30, 20, 10, and 0 d before rice planting). There was a decrease in rice yield from 2866 kg ha-1 to 2322 kg ha-1 when the herbicide was applied closer to the rice planting day. Glyphosate application on cover crops increased shikimate concentrations in rice seedlings cultivated under palisade grass (Brachiaria brizantha), signal grass (B. ruziziensis), guinea grass (Panicum maximum), and weedy fallow (spontaneous vegetation) but not under millet (Pennisetum glaucum), which behaved similarly to the control (clean fallow, no glyphosate application). Glyphosate applications in the timing intervals used were associated with stress in the rice plants, and this association increased if cover crops took longer to completely dry and if higher amounts of biomass were produced. Millet, as a cover crop, allowed the highest seedling dry matter for upland rice and the highest rice yield. Our results suggest that using millet as a cover crop, with glyphosate application far from upland rice planting day (10 d or more), was the best option for upland rice under a no-tillage system.},

While the title might be novel, its associated practices have long been employed by farmers, and studied by social scientists seeking to understand the reasons for their adoption and non-adoption. This paper reviews and synthesizes this past research in order to identify those independent variables that regularly explain adoption, and thereby facilitate policy prescriptions to augment adoption around the world. While a disaggregated analysis of a subset of commonly used variables reveals some underlying patterns of influence, once various contextual factors (e.g. study locale or method) are controlled, the primary finding of the synthesis is that there are few if any universal variables that regularly explain the adoption of conservation agriculture across past analyses. Given the limited prospect of identifying such variables through further research, we conclude that efforts to promote conservation agriculture will have to be tailored to reflect the particular conditions of individual locales.},

In 2014, the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (SARE) and the Conservation Technology Information Center (CTIC) collected data on cover crop use from producers across the United States. Using data from early adopters of the practice, we examine the factors associated with higher percentage of land planted to cover crops and reliance on cost-share assistance. In addition, we provide rare insight into the number of producers discontinuing their use of cover crops and examine whether this group is distinguishable from continuous users. By understanding how producers use and finance cover crops, and identifying those most likely to continue their use, we provide insights into how policymakers and conservation staff can modify their strategies and increase the number of long-term cover crop users. Continuous use among early adopters is associated with a willingness to self-learn and experiment through trial and error, whereas the small number of producers in our sample discontinuing the practice typically operate large farms and perceive adoption to be limited in their area by the increased difficulties and costs cover crops bring to farm management. Promoters of cover crops should attempt to combat these perceptions by showcasing local examples where limitations have successfully been overcome. Despite evidence of concerns over the cost of cover crops, many current users are continuing to expand their cover crop land without the use of cost-share funding.},

  abstract = {Cover crops are known to promote many aspects of soil and water quality, yet estimates find that in 2012 only 2.3\% of the total agricultural lands in the Midwestern USA were using cover crops. Focus groups were conducted across the Corn Belt state of Iowa to better understand how farmers confront barriers to cover crop adoption in highly intensive agricultural production systems. Although much prior research has focused on analyzing factors that help predict cover crop use on farms, there is limited research on how farmers navigate and overcome field-level (e.g. proper planting of a cover crop) and structural barriers (e.g. market forces) associated with the use of cover crops. The results from the analysis of these conversations suggest that there is a complex dialectical relationship between farmers' individual management decisions and the broader agricultural context in the region that constrains their decisions. Farmers in these focus groups shared how they navigate complex management decisions within a generally homogenized agricultural and economic landscape that makes cover crop integration challenging. Many who joined the focus groups have found ways to overcome barriers and successfully integrate cover crops into their cropping systems. This is illustrated through farmers' descriptions of their ‘whole system’ approach to cover crops management, where they described how they prioritize the success of their cover crops by focusing on multiple aspects of management, including changes they have made to nutrient application and modifications to equipment. These producers also engage with farmer networks to gain strategies for overcoming management challenges associated with cover crops. Although many participants had successfully planted cover crops, they tended to believe that greater economic incentives and/or more diverse crop and livestock markets would be needed to spur more widespread adoption of the practice. Our results further illustrate how structural and field-level barriers constrain individual actions, as it is not simply the basic agronomic considerations (such as seeding and terminating cover crops) that pose a challenge to their use, but also the broader economic and market drivers that exist in agriculturally intensive systems. Our study provides evidence that reducing structural barriers to adoption may be necessary to increase the use of this conservation practice to reduce environmental impacts associated with intensive agricultural production.},

Density and biomass composition in the mixtures were highly correlated with rye and vetch seeding rates, with little evidence of substantial interspeci c interference. Total shoot biomass in all mixtures was equal to or greater than that of either monoculture, but no di erences were detected in vetch winter survival or the e ciency of N2 xation. Changing the proportions of rye and vetch in the mixtures resulted in tradeo s related to N and weed management goals. Increasing vetch in mixtures led to greater xed N accumulation but also increased seed costs and reduced winter annual weed suppression. A greater understanding of how rye–vetch mixture proportions in uence cover crop performance can support more-informed decision-making regarding cover crop selection and mixture seeding rates.},

  abstract = {First- and second-year seedbank emergence of 23 summer annual weed species common to U.S. corn production systems was studied. Field experiments were conducted between 1996 and 1999 at the Iowa State University Johnson Farm in Story County, Iowa. In the fall of 1996 and again in 1997, 1,000 seeds for most species were planted in plastic crates. Seedling emergence was counted weekly for a 2-yr period following seed burial (starting in early spring). Soil temperature at 2 cm depth was estimated using soil temperature and moisture model software (STM2). The Weibull function was fit to cumulative emergence (\%) on cumulative thermal time (TT), hydrothermal time (HTT), and day of year (DOY). To identify optimum base temperature (Tbase) and base matric potential (ψbase) for calculating TT or HTT, Tbase and ψbase values ranging from 2 to 17 C and −33 to −1,500 kPa, respectively, were evaluated for each species. The search for the optimal model for each species was based on the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), whereas an extra penalty cost was added to HTT models. In general, fewer seedlings emerged during the first year of the first experimental run (approximately 18\% across all species) than during the second experimental run (approximately 30\%). However, second-year seedbank emergence was similar for both experimental runs (approximately 6\%). Environmental effects may be the cause of differences in total seedling emergence among years. Based on the AIC criterion, for 17 species, the best fit of the model occurred using Tbase ranging from 2 to 15 C with four species also responding to ψbase = −750 kPa. For six species, a simple model using DOY resulted in the best fit. Adding penalty costs to AIC calculation allowed us to compare TT and HTT when both models behaved similarly. Using a constant Tbase, species were plotted and classified as early-, middle-, and late-emerging species, resulting in a practical tool for forecasting time of emergence. The results of this research provide robust information on the prediction of the time of summer annual weed emergence, which can be used to schedule weed and crop management.},

The benefits of using cover crops are well established, but adoption in agronomic farming systems is unknown. The objectives of this study were to quantify cover crop use and identify factors associated with their adoption. A mail survey was sent to 3,500 farmers in the US corn belt (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Minnesota) to quantify farming practices and cover crop use. An estimated 18\% of farmers have used cover crops, including 11\% who planted cover crops sometime in the last five years, and 8\% who planted cover crops in the fall of 2005. In the fall of 2005, farmers who used cover crops planted them on 6\% of the land area for the average size farm. Logistic regression results indicated that crop diversity in a farm operation was the most consistent and important factor related to the use of cover crops. Corn belt farmers believe that cover crops are most effective at reducing soil erosion (96\%) and increasing soil organic matter (74\%). Approximately 56\% of farmers indicated that they would plant cover crops if cost-sharing was available. The mean minimum payment required as an incentive to plant cover crops would be approximately \$56.81 ha−1 (\$23 ac−1).},

Weeds are most competitive with crops at early growth stages, and a management strategy that ensures early season weed suppression in crops is crucial for crop growth, development, and yield. In this study, systematic and meta-analytic reviews of published studies from 1990 to January 2017 were conducted to provide evidence on whether using cover crops can provide satisfactory weed suppression at termination of the cover crop and up to 7 wk after planting of the main crop. The impact of cover crops as a weed control input on main crop yield was also evaluated. A total of 46 relevant field studies were evaluated. Main crops were planted 1 to 3 wk after termination of the cover crops. Overall, our meta-analysis results indicated that cover crops provided early season weed suppression comparable to those provided by chemical and mechanical weed control methods in cropping systems. The use of cover crops for early season weed suppression had no effect on main crop grain yields, but could increase vegetable crop yields when compared with no cover crop. Decisions about selecting cover crops species type (broadleaf or grass) or number (single or mixtures) were not as important as identifying cover crops with inherent characteristics that suppress weeds, such as high biomass productivity and persistent residue.},

Field studies were conducted in 2013, 2014, and 2015 in Columbia, Missouri to investigate the effects of common residual herbicides applied in corn and soybean on establishment of winter wheat, tillage radish, cereal rye, crimson clover, winter oat, Austrian winter pea, Italian ryegrass, and hairy vetch. Cover crops were evaluated for stand and biomass reduction 28 d after emergence (DAE). Rainfall from herbicide application to cover crop seeding date was much greater in 2014 and 2015, which resulted in less carryover in these years compared to 2013. When averaged across all herbicides evaluated in these experiments, the general order of sensitivity of cover crops to herbicide carryover, from greatest to least was Austrian winter pea = crimson clover {$>$} oilseed radish {$>$} Italian ryegrass {$>$} hairy vetch {$>$} wheat {$>$} winter oat {$>$}cereal rye. Cereal rye had the fewest instances of biomass or stand reduction with only four out of the 27 herbicides adversely effecting establishment. Pyroxasulfone consistently reduced Italian ryegrass and winter oat biomass at least 67\% in both the corn and soybean experiments. In the soybean experiment, imazethapyr- and fomesafen-containing products resulted in severe stand and biomass reduction in both years while ﬂumetsulam-containing products resulted in the greatest carryover symptoms in the corn experiment. Results from these experiments suggest that several commonly used corn and soybean herbicides have the potential to hinder cover crop establishment, but the severity of damage will depend on weather, cover crop species, and the speciﬁc herbicide combination.

To address the variability in response, previous qualitative and quantitative reviews have summarized the overall yield effects of WCCs. However, the results from such reviews need constant revision as new research is published and interest in the conservation benefits of WCCs increases. Here, we update a previous meta-analysis of WCC effects on corn (Zea mays) yields, which summarized peer-reviewed research from the United Sates and Canada that was published between 1965 and 2004. Our updated data set (1965 to 2015) comprises 268 observations from 65 studies conducted in different regions of the United States and Canada, and includes information about the management practices utilized (i.e., WCC species, nitrogen [N] fertilization, termination date, tillage, etc.). The effect-size was the response ratio (RR), defined as corn yield following WCCs relative to yield after no cover crop (NC). As in the previous meta-analysis, our results showed a neutral to positive contribution of WCCs to corn yields. On average, grass WCCs neither increased nor decreased corn yields, although corn grown for grain yielded relatively higher than silage corn after grass WCCs. Legume WCCs resulted in subsequent higher corn yields by 30\% to 33\% when N fertilizer rates were low or the tillage system shifted from conventional tillage (CT) to no-tillage (NT). Mixture WCCs increased corn yields by 30\% when the cover crop was late terminated (zero to six days before subsequent corn). Evidence of 65 years of research showed that uncertainty around the RR has decreased and corn yield response to WCCs has stabilized over time. Our results suggest that benefits of WCCs do not result in reduced corn productivity if properly managed.},

  abstract = {Natural resources conservation is a key national priority of Brazilian cropping systems, especially in the soybean and sugarcane agricultural areas of central/south and southeast/northeast, respectively. Society has influenced growers to adopt “conservation cropping systems”, which results in reduced damage to the agricultural environment (agro ecosystems) as a whole. These systems are based on plant residue covering the soil surface (cover crop or residue after harvest), with a minimum disturbance of the topsoil layer. These systems, when compared to the conventional cropping system, reduce diurnal soil temperature variation, decrease water evaporation from the soil surface, enhance organic matter content and microorganism activity in the topsoil layer, improve both the physical and chemical soil properties, and provide better soil erosion control. The widespread adoption of no tillage soybean production systems has achieved tremendous success in enhancing soil quality and preventing soil erosion. Plant residue covering the soil surface influences the weed population dynamics through chemical (carbon/nitrogen ratio and allelopathy), biological (parasitism and predation by microorganisms, insects and small mammals) and physical factors (less direct sunlight reaching the soil surface, reduced diurnal soil temperature variation and physical obstruction of weed emergence). Weed control by pre-emergence herbicides is also directly affected by the plant residue covering on the soil, since these residues may intercept the herbicide, preventing part of the sprayed herbicide from the soil by adsorption, therefore, influencing the efficacy of the herbicide. Overall weed management tactics need to be studied and reconsidered for this new “conservation cropping system” as compared to the conventional systems.},

Both species are highly adaptable and emerge continuously throughout the summer months, presenting the need for a residual PRE application in soybean. To improve season-long control of Amaranthus spp., 19 PRE treatments were evaluated on glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth in 2013 and 2014 at locations in Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, Illinois, and Tennessee; and on glyphosate-resistant waterhemp at locations in Illinois, Missouri, and Nebraska. The two Amaranthus species were analyzed separately; data for each species were pooled across site-years, and site-year was included as a random variable in the analyses. The dissipation of weed control throughout the course of the experiments was compared among treatments with the use of regression analysis where percent weed control was described as a function of time (the number of weeks after treatment [WAT]). At the mean (i.e., average) WAT (4.3 and 3.2 WAT for Palmer amaranth and waterhemp, respectively) isoxaflutole + S-metolachlor + metribuzin had the highest predicted control of Palmer amaranth (98\%) and waterhemp (99\%). Isoxaflutole + S-metolachlor + metribuzin, S-metolachlor + mesotrione, and flumioxazin + pyroxasulfone had a predicted control ≥ 97\% and similar model parameter estimates, indicating control declined at similar rates for these treatments. Dicamba and 2,4-D provided some, short-lived residual control of Amaranthus spp. When dicamba was added to metribuzin or S-metolachlor, control increased compared to dicamba alone. Flumioxazin + pyroxasulfone, a currently labeled PRE, performed similarly to treatments containing isoxaflutole or mesotrione. Additional sites of action will provide soybean growers more opportunities to control these weeds and reduce the potential for herbicide resistance.

Amaranthus palmeri y Amaranthus tuberculatus se han convertido en malezas que son cada vez más problemáticas a lo largo de los Estados Unidos. Ambas especies son altamente adaptables y emergen en forma continua durante los meses de verano, lo que hace que sea necesaria la aplicación PRE de herbicidas residuales en soja. Para mejorar el control de Amaranthus spp. durante toda la temporada de crecimiento, se evaluaron 19 tratamientos PRE sobre A. palmeri resistente a glyphosate en 2013 y 2014 en sitios en Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, Illinois, y Tennessee; y sobre A. tuberculatus resistente a glyphosate en sitios en Illinois, Missouri, y Nebraska. Las dos especies de Amaranthus fueron analizadas en forma separada; los datos de los dos años fueron combinados para cada especie, y el efecto sitio-año fue incluido como un efecto aleatorio en los análisis. La disipación del control de malezas a lo largo del curso de los experimentos fue comparada entre tratamientos con el uso de análisis de regresión, donde el porcentaje de control de malezas fue descrito en función del tiempo (el número de semanas después del tratamiento [WAT]). En la media (i.e., promedio) WAT (4.3 y 3.2 WAT para A. palmeri y A. tuberculatus, respectivamente), isoxaflutole + S-metolachlor + metribuzin tuvo el mayor control predicho de A. palmeri, (98\%) y A. tuberculatus (99\%). Isoxaflutole + S-metolachlor + metribuzin, S-metolachlor + mesotrione, y flumioxazin + pyroxasulfone tuvieron un control predicho ≥97\% y parámetros estimados del modelo similares, indicando que el control disminuyó a tasas similares entre estos tratamientos. Dicamba y 2,4-D brindaron algo de control residual de poca duración de Amaranthus spp. Cuando dicamba fue agregado a metribuzin o S-metolachlor, el control aumentó al compararse con dicamba solo. Flumioxazin + pyroxasulfone, un herbicida PRE actualmente registrado, mostró un desempeño similar a los tratamientos que contenían isoxaflutole o mesotrione.

This study compared the effects of drilling sugar beet directly into a cover crop of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or rye (Secale cereal L.), or after conventional tillage in spring, on soil physical conditions and crop establishment. The experiments were conducted over 4 years in the north of France on three soil types: chalky soil (rendzina), loam soil (calcic cambisol) and silt loam soil (gleyic luvisol). Direct drilling caused less soil compaction than conventional drilling; the wheel tracks for seed bed preparation were made in drier conditions for direct drilling because of the change in tillage time (autumn for direct drilling vs. spring for conventional drilling). Seed bed structure, temperature and water content, and seed placement were very similar for the two drilling techniques (except in the silt loam soil) because of soil tillage done by the sugar beet seed drill and removal of cover crop residues over the sugar beet rows. Final emergence percentage was lower with direct drilling because of predator damage (by skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and/or field mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). Seedling growth after emergence was slower with direct drilling. The negative effects of direct drilling on sugar beet establishment may be counteracted by increasing the seed density, or by its positive effects on soil structure and consequently the possibility to sow sugar beet earlier. Because of its environmental advantages, direct drilling of sugar beet into a cover crop is an interesting technique for large farms with heavy work loads in spring in areas where the soil has a high aggregate stability.},

Several studies indicate that cover crops could replace anthropogenic inputs and enhance crop productivity. However, so far, it is unclear if cover crop effects vary between different cropping systems, and direct comparisons among major arable production systems are rare. Here we compared the short-term effects of various cover crops on crop yield, nitrogen uptake, and weed infestation in four arable production systems (conventional cropping with intensive tillage and no-tillage; organic cropping with intensive tillage and reduced tillage). We hypothesized that cover cropping effects increase with decreasing management intensity. Our study demonstrated that cover crop effects on crop yield were highest in the organic system with reduced tillage (+24\%), intermediate in the organic system with tillage (+13\%) and in the conventional system with no tillage (+8\%) and lowest in the conventional system with tillage (+2\%). Our results indicate that cover crops are essential to maintaining a certain yield level when soil tillage intensity is reduced (e.g. under conservation agriculture), or when production is converted to organic agriculture. Thus, the inclusion of cover crops provides additional opportunities to increase the yield of lower intensity production systems and contribute to ecological intensification.},

  abstract = {In fall 2000, an on-farm sustainable agricultural research project was established for cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., in Tift County, Georgia. The objective of our 2-yr research project was to determine the impact of several cover crops on pest and predator insects in cotton. The Þve cover crop treatments included 1) cereal rye, Secale cereale L., a standard grass cover crop; 2) crimson clover, Trifolium incarnatum L., a standard legume cover crop; 3) a legume mixture of balansa clover, Trifolium michelianum Savi; crimson clover; and hairy vetch, Vicia villosa Roth; 4) a legume mixture ϩ rye combination; and 5) no cover crop in conventionally tilled Þelds. Three main groups or species of pests were collected in cover crops and cotton: 1) the heliothines Heliothis virescens (F.) and Helicoverpa zea (Boddie); 2) the tarnished plant bug, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois); and 3) stink bugs. The main stink bugs collected were the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.); the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus (Say); and the green stink bug, Acrosternum hilare (Say). Cotton aphids, Aphis gossypii Glover, were collected only on cotton. For both years of the study, the heliothines were the only pests that exceeded their economic threshold in cotton, and the number of times this threshold was exceeded in cotton was higher in control cotton than in crimson clover and rye cotton. Heliothine predators and aphidophagous lady beetles occurred in cover crops and cotton during both years of the experiment. Geocoris punctipes (Say), Orius insidiosus (Say), and red imported Þre ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren were relatively the most abundant heliothine predators observed. Lady beetles included the convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens Gue´rin-Me´neville; the sevenspotted lady beetle, Coccinella septempunctata L.; spotted lady beetle, Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer); and the multicolored Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas). Density of G. punctipes was higher in cotton Þelds previously planted in crimson clover compared with control cotton Þelds for all combined sampling dates in 2001. Intercropping cotton in live strips of cover crop was probably responsible for the relay of G. punctipes onto cotton in these crimson clover Þelds. Density of O. insidiosus was not signiÞcantly different between cover crop and control cotton Þelds. Lady beetles seemed to relay from cover crops into cotton. Conservation of the habitat of Þre ants during planting probably was responsible for the higher density of red imported Þre ants observed in all conservation tillage cotton Þelds relative to control cotton Þelds. Reduction in the number of times in which economic thresholds for heliothines were exceeded in crimson clover and rye compared with control Þelds indicated that the buildup of predaceous Þre ants and G. punctipes in these cover crops subsequently resulted in reduction in the level of heliothines in conservation tillage cotton with these cover crops compared with conventional tillage cotton without cover crops.},

  abstract = {Substantial reproduction of Meloidogyne incognita on winter cover crops may lead to damaging populations in a subsequent cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) crop. The amount of population increase during the winter depends on soil temperature and the host status of the cover crop. Our objectives were to quantify M. incognita race 3 reproduction on rye (Secale cereale) and several leguminous cover crops and to determine if these cover crops increase population densities of M. incognita and subsequent damage to cotton. The cover crops tested were ‘Bigbee’ berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum), ‘Paradana’ balansa clover (T. balansae), ‘AU Sunrise’ and ‘Dixie’ crimson clover (T. incarnatum), ‘Cherokee’ red clover (T. pratense), common and ‘AU Early Cover’ hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), ‘Cahaba White’ vetch (V. sativa), and ‘Wrens Abruzzi’ rye. In the greenhouse tests, egg production was greatest on berseem clover, Dixie crimson clover, AU Early Cover hairy vetch, and common hairy vetch; intermediate on Balansa clover and AU Sunrise crimson clover; and least on rye, Cahaba White vetch, and Cherokee red clover. In both 2002 and 2003 field tests, enough heat units were accumulated between 1 January and 20 May for the nematode to complete two generations. Both AU Early Cover and common hairy vetch led to greater root galling than fallow in the subsequent cotton crop; they also supported high reproduction of M. incognita in the greenhouse. Rye and Cahaba White vetch did not increase root galling on cotton and were relatively poor hosts for M. incognita. Only those legumes that increased populations of M. incognita reduced cotton yield. In the southern US, M. incognita can complete one to two generations on a susceptible winter cover crop, so cover crops that support high nematode reproduction may lead to damage and yield losses in the following cotton crop. Planting rye or Meloidogyne-resistant legumes as winter cover crops will lower the risk of increased nematode populations compared to most vetches and clovers.},

  abstract = {We evaluated the hypothesis that the use of an autumn-seeded winter rye, Secale cereale L., cover crop in soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., could lead to decreased insect pest pressure. We compared insect pest and natural enemy populations in an organic soybean production system with soybeans planted into an autumn-seeded rye cover crop (i.e., soybeans planted in spring into a rye cover crop that had been planted the previous autumn). Small-plot experiments were conducted at two locations in southwestern Minnesota to compare insect populations on soybean planted into fallow ground versus soybean planted into rye that was managed by mowing using three different techniques. Densities of potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae (Harris), were signiÞcantly lower on soybean in all of the rye treatments compared with soybean without rye at both locations. Densities of soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, were signiÞcantly lower on all of the treatments incorporating rye than the soybean-only treatment at one site, but the suppressive effect of rye depended on the speciÞcs of rye planting at the other site. Densities of bean leaf beetle, Cerotoma trifurcata (Fo¨ rster), were signiÞcantly lower in the rye plots than soybean-only plots at one of the two sites. Foliar-foraging insect predator densities did not differ signiÞcantly among treatments at either site. Soybean yields did not differ signiÞcantly among treatments at either location although there was a trend for lower yield in two of the rye treatments. A statewide survey also was conducted to compare A. glycines infestations in Minnesota soybean Þelds with and without a rye cover crop. The proportion of plants infested and infestation ratings were both signiÞcantly lower in soybean Þelds with rye than in those without.},

  abstract = {No-tillage with stubble retention is a widely used cropping system for its conservation and yield benefits. The no-tillage farming system in southern Australia relies heavily on herbicides for weed management, but heavy crop residues may have a negative impact on the activity of pre-emergent herbicides applied. Any herbicide intercepted by the crop residue may not reach the soil surface without timely rainfall and may dissipate due to volatilisation, photo-degradation and/or microbial activity. Two experiments were carried out to investigate the interception of prosulfocarb, pyroxasulfone, and trifluralin herbicides by wheat residue and retention following simulated rainfall. For the first experiment, there were four simulated rainfall amounts (0, 5, 10, and 20 mm), three intensities (5, 10, and 20 mm h–1) and five application times (immediately after spraying herbicide, 6 h, 1, 7, and 14 days after spraying). In the second experiment, 20 mm of rainfall was applied at 10 mm h–1 in either 4 × 5 mm rainfall events over two days, 2 × 10 mm rainfall events over one day, or a single 20 mm rainfall event, with a no-rainfall control treatment. Bioassays were used to assess the herbicide activity/availability in the soil and remaining on the residue, using cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) as indicator plants. At higher rainfall amounts, most of the herbicide leached from the stubble into the soil soon after application; more so with rain in one event rather than multiple events. However, the intensity of rainfall had no effect. Pyroxasulfone leached easily from the residue to the soil to potentially offer good weed control, prosulfocarb had an intermediary leaching effect, while only a small amount of trifluralin leached from stubble after rain. Therefore, in no-tillage situations with large amounts of crop residue present on the soil surface, herbicides that leach easily from the residue should be considered, like pyroxasulfone.},
